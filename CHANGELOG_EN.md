# Change Log

## 0.4.15

`NEW` When the variable itself has only one definition, the variable is treated as a constant. If the variable is treated as a constant and is a string or numeric type, the constant is displayed when the code completion and hover prompts the variable.

`NEW` restarts deprecated rendering, but only when the corresponding configuration is checked

## 0.4.14

`FIX` Fix the problem of suspended animation caused by the last PR

`NEW` emmylua debugger compilation standard raised to C++11

## 0.4.12

`FIX` fixes multithreading issues

`FIX` correctly supports debugging under macos arm64 architecture

`NEW` Added nullable descriptions on function parameters such as `---@param a? number`

`NEW` The function parameter check will check whether the number of parameters is too small. If there are too few parameters and the subsequent parameters do not display the mark and can be empty, an error will be reported

`NEW` When debugging, if the file cannot be found according to the chunkname, it will try to find it again with the currently open workspace as the root directory `contribute by @whitecostume`

`NEW` other details update

## 0.4.11

`FIX` A bug that is not resolved when other extension suffixes are associated with lua

## 0.4.10

`FIX` fixes performance issues due to diagnostics being moved to daemon thread execution. Code hints and associated rendering are available immediately after code parsing

## 0.4.9

`FIX` fix the problem that the parsing is too slow under the default option, temporarily remove the deprecated related diagnosis

## 0.4.8

`NEW` unrecognized tags no longer warn

`NEW` experimentally supports a series of check configurations including `assignment safety check`, `subdomain existence check`, `undefined variable usage check`, `function parameter type safety`

`NEW` supports hint when class method overrides the function of the same name of the parent class

`NEW` other small details update

## 0.4.7

`FIX` jdk changed back to 8

## 0.4.6

`FIX` has many crashes due to changes in the compilation environment, and is now temporarily changed back 
## 0.4.4

The underline color of `NEW` upvalue can be configured. When the configuration content is empty, the underline will not be displayed.

`NEW` deprecated annotation is valid for global functions

`NEW` experimental support for subdomain existence check

`NEW` Use ctrl jump at definition to jump to usage 

## 0.4.3

`FIX` CodeLens error

## 0.4.2
`FIX` fix the bug that @private annotation does not work correctly

`NEW` supports @deprecated annotations and related diagnostics

`NEW` experimentally supports the string inline expression annotation `string<T>`. When the function parameter uses this annotation, the corresponding function call will prompt the field of the `T` class in the string, you can use string <_G> indicates the prompt global variable in the string 

## 0.4.1

`FIX` fix a crash caused by using fixPath

## 0.4.0
