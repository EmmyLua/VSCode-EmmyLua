`FIX` correctly supports debugging under macos arm64 architecture

`NEW` Added nullable descriptions on function parameters such as `---@param a? number`

`NEW` When debugging, if the file cannot be found according to the chunkname, it will try to find it again with the currently open workspace as the root directory `contribute by @whitecostume`

`NEW` other details update

## 0.4.11

`FIX` A bug that is not resolved when other extension suffixes are associated with lua

## 0.4.10

## 0.4.8

`NEW` unrecognized tags no longer warn

`NEW` experimentally supports a series of check configurations including `assignment safety check`, `subdomain existence check`, `undefined variable usage check`, `function parameter type safety`

`NEW` supports hint when class method overrides the function of the same name of the parent class

`NEW` other small details update

## 0.4.7

`FIX` jdk changed back to 8

## 0.4.6

`FIX` has many crashes due to changes in the compilation environment, and is now temporarily changed back

`NEW` deprecated annotation is valid for global functions

`NEW` experimental support for subdomain existence check

`NEW` Use ctrl jump at definition to jump to usage 

## 0.4.3

`FIX` CodeLens error

## 0.4.2
`FIX` fix the bug that @private annotation does not work correctly

`NEW` supports @deprecated annotations and related diagnostics

`NEW` experimentally supports the string inline expression annotation `string<T>`. When the function parameter uses this annotation, the corresponding function call will prompt the field of the `T` class in the string, you can use string <_G> indicates the prompt global variable in the string 

## 0.4.1

`FIX` fix a crash caused by using fixPath

## 0.4.0
