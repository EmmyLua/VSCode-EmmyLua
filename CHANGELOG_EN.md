# Change Log

# 0.7.2

`NEW` CodeLens feature is enabled by default

`NEW` Support for decimals in the form of `.1`

`NEW` Workspace code diagnostics are parallelized to take full advantage of multi-core CPUs

`NEW` Document diagnostics are asynchronous and include a built-in 1-second debounce mechanism to reduce the impact on performance

`NEW` Document updates are delayed by 0.1 seconds, so the document content is not immediately updated when typing quickly

`NEW` Optimized file monitoring update mechanism within the workspace, supporting batch updates (mainly updates from version control tools like git)

`NEW` Support for callable inference of classes, for example:
```lua
---@class A
---@overload fun(a, b, c): A
A = {}

local a = A(1, 2, 3) -- A
```

`NEW` Support for strict mode configuration, the current strict mode configuration is:
```json
{
  "strict": {
    "requirePath": true,
    "typeCall": true
  }
}
```
If `requirePath` is set to `false`, it allows require paths to not start from the root directory. If `typeCall` is set to `false`, it allows direct calls of any type to return the type itself.

`FIX` Fixed some inference issues

`FIX` Fixed crashes caused by duplicate file additions when workspaces overlap

`FIX` Fixed inline comment judgment logic

`FIX` Optimized generic function inference

# 0.7.1

`FIX` Debugger rolled back to 1.7.1, the debugger will be updated in the next version

# 0.7.0

`NEW` The language service implemented in dotnet officially begins to replace the Java version of the language service. The Java version of the language service will be removed in version 1.0 and is now enabled in a legacy form.

`NEW` Debugger updated to 1.8.0

`NEW` Supports string generics, for example:
```lua
---@generic T
---@param a `T`
---@return T
function TypeOf(a)
end

local a = TypeOf("string") -- string type
```

`FIX` Fixed some issues with type inference

`NOTE` All vscode configurations are invalid for the dotnet version of the language service. Its configuration requires creating a .emmyrc.json file in the root directory. A template configuration is:

}
```

The `NEW` emitter-style overload extends support to the main signature when the first parameter is number can be written like this:
```lua

---@overload fun(level: "ngx.INFO", info)
---@overload fun(level: "ngx.WARN", msg)
---@param level number
function ngx.log(level, ...) end
```

## 0.4.18

`NEW` `@field` annotation now supports numeric field descriptions:
```lua
---@field[1]number
---@field[2] string
```
Index descriptions of numbers or strings are also supported:
```lua
---@field [number] string
---@field [string] string
```
Several ways can coexist in a class definition.

`NEW` supports emitter style overloading:
```lua

---@overload fun(a: "data", data)
---@overload fun(a: "listen", aa, bb, cc)
---@param a string
local function f(a, bbb)
end
```

`NEW` enumeration can mark inherited classes:
```lua
---@enum aaaa: number
```
After an enumeration inherits from a class, parameter type checking checks whether the parameter conforms to the parent class.

`NEW` supports enum based overloading:
```lua
---@enum IO: number
io = {
     Input = 1,
     Output = 2
}

---@overload fun(type: "IO.Input", in)
---@overload fun(type: "IO.Output", writeHandle)
---@param type IO
local function f(type, ...)
end
```

`NOTE` The new overloading style above must be `enum/string` in the first parameter of the function

## 0.4.16

`NEW` Experimental support feature `interface` This feature has the following characteristics:

`Feature 1` interface has the following written form:
```lua
---@interface A
---@field a number
---@field b number
```

`Feature 2` interfaces can be inherited:
```lua
---A is the interface A above
---@class C : A
```
When inheriting an interface, the diagnostic checks if the class implements the members of the interface

`Feature 3` When an interface is used as a parameter type, after the function parameter verification feature is enabled, it will check whether the incoming parameter conforms to the interface. If the incoming parameter is not inherited from the interface or is a table expression, then Will check each member of the interface definition for conformity

`Restriction` interface cannot inherit from other classes or other interfaces


`NEW` Multiple interface inheritance, type declarations can now multiple inherit interfaces in the following form
```lua
---@interface b
---@interface c

---@class a: b, c
```
`Restriction`: In the case of multiple inheritance, only one class is allowed to inherit, the rest can only be interfaces, and the class is only allowed to appear in the first inheritance bit

## 0.4.15

`NEW` When the variable itself has only one definition, the variable is treated as a constant. If the variable is treated as a constant and is a string or numeric type, the constant is displayed when the code completion and hover prompts the variable.

`NEW` restarts deprecated rendering, but only when the corresponding configuration is checked

## 0.4.14

`FIX` Fix the problem of suspended animation caused by the last PR

`FIX` fixes multithreading issues

`FIX` correctly supports debugging under macos arm64 architecture

`NEW` Added nullable descriptions on function parameters such as `---@param a? number`

`NEW` The function parameter check will check whether the number of parameters is too small. If there are too few parameters and the subsequent parameters do not display the mark and can be empty, an error will be reported

`NEW` When debugging, if the file cannot be found according to the chunkname, it will try to find it again with the currently open workspace as the root directory `contribute by @whitecostume`

`NEW` other details update

## 0.4.11

`FIX` A bug that is not resolved when other extension suffixes are associated with lua
