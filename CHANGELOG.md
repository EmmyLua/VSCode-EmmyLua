# Change Log

[‰∏≠ÊñáLog](CHANGELOG_CN.md)

## [0.9.26] - 2025-7-27
### üêõ Fixed
- **Fix create an empty directory**:  Fixed an issue where the language server would create an empty directory.
### üîß Changed
- **Rust Edition 2024**: The language server is now built with Rust Edition 2024, which brings various performance and stability improvements.

## [0.9.25] - 2025-7-25
### üîß Changed
- **Refactor generic function inference**: Lambda function parameters now use deferred matching, allowing generic types to be inferred from other parameters first. For example:
```lua
---@generic T
---@param f1 fun(...: T...): any
---@param ... T...
function invoke(f1, ...)
    
end

invoke(function(a, b, c) -- infer as: integer, integer, integer
    print(a, b, c)
end, 1, 2, 3)
```

- **Generic Type Decay**: Now, generic types that match constants of integer, string, float, or boolean will be directly converted to their corresponding general types.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Use Mimalloc**: Mimalloc is now the default memory allocator, improving performance and memory management. Startup performance is increased by about 50%.
- **Lua 5.5 Syntax Support**: More complete support for Lua 5.5 syntax, including `global` declarations, `table.create`, and the new attribute syntax. For example:
```lua
local <const> a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
global <const> d, e, f
```
Also supports immutability checks for iterator variables in for loop statements.


- **Doc Cli Modification**: Improved the documentation CLI to better handle various edge cases and provide more accurate suggestions.

### üêõ Fixed

- **Fix load order**: Fixed an issue where the order of loading files could lead to incorrect type inference.
- **Fix Unpack infer**: Fixed an issue where unpacking a table in a table.
- **Fix rename in @param**: Fixed an issue where renaming a parameter in a function param.

## [0.9.24] - 2025-7-11
### üîß Changed

- **Flow Inference Refactor**: Refactored flow analysis algorithm, now uses a TypeScript-like flow analysis approach for better handling of complex scenarios.
- **Doc CLI**: Changed export format, now supports multiple `@see` and other tag flags.

### ‚ú® Added

- **TypeGuard Now Supports Generics**: You can now use generic parameters in TypeGuard, e.g. `TypeGuard<T>`.
- **Type Narrowing by Constant Fields**: Supports type narrowing using constant fields.
- **Basic Range Checking**: Array type indexing is now less frequently nullable.

### üêõ Fixed

- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed various bugs.

## [0.9.23] - 2025-6-27

### ‚ú® Added
- **Support for Descriptions Above and After Tags**: You can now add descriptions both above a tag (as a preceding comment) and after a tag (inline). The description will be associated with the corresponding tag.
  ```lua
  ---@class A
  --- Description below (applies to the @field a)
  ---@field a integer inline-description
  ---@field b integer # description after hash
  --- Description above (applies to the @field b)
  ---@field c integer inline-description
  local a = {}
  ```
- **Add call `__call` hint**: Add call `__call` hint, enable by `hint.metaCallHint`
  ```lua
  ---@class A
  ---@overload fun(a: integer): integer
  local A
  A(1) -- There will be a lightning prompt between `A` and `(` or a `new` prompt before `A`
  ```

- **Support syntax`--[[@cast -?]]`**: When `@cast` is followed by an operator instead of a name, it will convert the type of the previous expression, but currently only works for function calls!

- **Quick Fix for Nil Removal**: Added quick fix action for `NeedCheckNil` diagnostic that suggests using `@cast` to remove nil type
  ```lua
  ---@class Cast1
  ---@field get fun(self: self, a: number): Cast1?
  local A

  local _a = A:get(1) --[[@cast -?]]:get(2):get(3) -- Quick fix will prompt whether to automatically add `--[[@cast -?]]`
  ```
- **Base Function Name Completion**: Added `completion.baseFunctionIncludesName` configuration to control whether function names are included in base function completions
  ```json
  {
    "completion": {
      "baseFunctionIncludesName": true
    }
  }
  ```
  When enabled, function completions will include the function name: `function name() end` instead of `function () end`

- **Cast Type Mismatch Diagnostic**: Added new diagnostic `CastTypeMismatch` to detect type mismatches in cast operations
  ```lua
  ---@type string
  local a = "hello"
  --[[@cast a int]] -- Warning
  ```

- **Auto Require Naming Convention Configuration**: Added `completion.autoRequireNamingConvention.keep-class` configuration option. When importing modules, if the return value is a class definition, the class name will be used; otherwise, the file name will be used
  ```json
  {
    "completion": {
      "autoRequireNamingConvention": "keep-class"
    }
  }
  ```

- **File rename prompts whether to update `require` paths**: Added prompt when renaming files to ask whether to update corresponding import statements


### üîß Changed
- **Class Method Completion**: When a function call jumps, if there are multiple declarations, It will then attempt to return the most matching definition along with all actual code declarations, rather than returning all definitions.

- **Definition Jump Enhancement**: When jumping to definition from function calls, if the target is located in a return statement, the language server will now attempt to find the original definition. For example:
  ```lua
  -- test.lua
  local function test()
  end
  return {
      test = test,
  }
  ```
  ```lua
  local t = require("test")
  local test = t.test -- Previously jumped to: test = test,
  test() -- Now jumps to: local function test()
  ```

### üêõ Fixed
- **Enum Variable Parameter Issue**: Fixed a crash issue when checking enum variable as parameter
- **Circle Doc Class Issue**: Fixed a bug that caused the language server to hang when
- **Fix debugger crash**: Fixed a crash issue in the debugger

# 0.9.22

`CHG` Generic constraint (StrTplRef) removes the protection for string: 
```lua
---@generic T: string -- need to remove `: string`
---@param a `T`
---@return T
local function class(a)
end

---@class A

local A = class("A") -- error
```

`NEW` Explicitly declared `Tuple` are immutable.
```lua
---@type [1, 2]
local a = {1, 2}

a[1] = 3 -- error
```

`FIX` Hover `function` now can show the corresponding doc comment.

`FIX` Fix a crash when `go to definition` of member

`NEW` Added the configuration item `classDefaultCall`, which is used to declare a method with the specified name as the default `__call` for a class. The effect is equivalent to `---@overload fun()`, but with a lower priority. If an explicitly declared `---@overload fun()` exists, `classDefaultCall` will have no effect on the class.

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "classDefaultCall": {
      "functionName": "__init",
      "forceNonColon": true,
      "forceReturnSelf": true
    }
  },
}
```

```lua
---@class MyClass
local M = {}

-- `functionName` is `__init`, so the call will be treated as `__init`
function M:__init(a)
    -- `forceReturnSelf` is `true`, so the call will return `self`. even if the method does not return `self` or returns some other value.
end


-- `forceNonColon` is `true`, so the call can be called without `:` and without passing `self`
-- `forceReturnSelf` is `true`, so the call will return `self`
A = M() -- `A` is `MyClass`
```


`NEW` Added `docBaseConstMatchBaseType` configuration item, default is `false`. Base constant types defined in doc can match base types, allowing int to match `---@alias id 1|2|3`, same for string.

```json
{
  "strict": {
    "docBaseConstMatchBaseType": true
  },
}
```

`FIX` When `enum` is used as a function parameter, it is treated as a value rather than the `enum` itself.

`FIX` When the expected type of a table field is a function, function completion is available.

`NEW` `inlay_hint` params hint can now jump to the actual type definition.

`NEW` When closing files in the editor that are not in the workspace or library, their impact will be removed

`NEW` Enhanced Ignore-related functionality. Files configured to be ignored will not be parsed even when opened, but due to technical constraints, files already open when starting the editor will still be parsed (to be fixed in a future update)


# 0.9.21

`NEW` Implement `std.Unpack` type for better type inference of the `unpack` function, and `std.Rawget` type for better type inference of the `rawget` function

`NEW` Improved generic parameter inference for lambda functions, now better inferring parameter types for lambda functions

`CHG` Changed `math.huge` to number type

`FIX` Optimized inference of variadic generic return values, now usable for asynchronous library return value inference:
```lua
--- @generic T, R
--- @param argc integer
--- @param func fun(...:T..., cb: fun(...:R...))
--- @return async fun(...:T...):R...
local function wrap(argc, func) end

--- @param a string
--- @param b string
--- @param callback fun(out: string)
local function system(a, b, callback) end

local wrapped = wrap(3, system)
```

`FIX` Optimized rendering of certain type hints

`NEW` Added documentation hints for modules and types in code completion

`NEW` Added type checking for intersection types

`NEW` Support for generic constraint checking, string template parameter type checking and code completion

`FIX` Fix performance issue where type checking drastically slows down when large Lua tables are present in the project, causing the entire project to become unresponsive


# 0.9.20

`FIX` Fix a crash issue

`NEW` Support `@return_cast` for functions. When a function's return value is boolean (must be annotated as boolean), you can add an additional annotation `---@return_cast <param> <cast op>`, indicating that when the function returns true, the parameter `<param>` will be transformed to the corresponding type according to the cast. For example:
```lua
---@return boolean
---@return_cast n integer
local function isInteger(n)
    return n == math.floor(n)
end

local a ---@type integer | string

if isInteger(a) then
    print(a) -- a: integer
else
    print(a) -- a: string
end
```

`@return_cast` support self param. For example:
```lua
---@class My2

---@class My1

---@class My3:My2,My1
local m = {}


---@return boolean
---@return_cast self My1
function m:isMy1()
end

---@return boolean
---@return_cast self My2
function m:isMy2()
end

if m:isMy1() then
    print(m) -- m: My1
elseif m:isMy2() then
    print(m) -- m: My2
end
```

`CHG` Remove diagnostic `lua-syntax-error`, it merges into `syntax-error`, add `doc-syntax-error` for doc syntax error

`FIX` Fix format issue, Now When exist `syntax-error`, the format never return value

`FIX` Fix a performance issue: prevent large union types when functions return tables

`CHG` When an object returned by require function is a class/enum, defining new members on it is prohibited, while tables are not restricted

`NEW` Support `Lua 5.5` global decl grammar

`NEW` Support `TypeGuard<T>` as return type. For example:
```lua

---@return TypeGuard<string>
local function is_string(value)
    return type(value) == "string"
end

local a

if is_string(a) then
    print(a:sub(1, 1))
else
    print("a is not a string")
end
```

# 0.9.19

`FIX` Fix reading configuration file encoded with UTF-8 BOM

`NEW` Support `Call hierarchy` but only support incomming call

`NEW` Support new tag `@internal` for members or declarations. When a member or declaration is marked as `@internal`, it is only visible within its current library.

`NEW` Fixed the error with multiple root directories on the IntelliJ platform.

`NEW` Added support for code formatting, which is implemented through the pinvoke reference `EmmyLuaCodeStyle`.

`NEW` VScode-EmmyLua-Unity plugin has been released. Users of Xlua can try installing and using it.

`NEW` Intellij-EmmyLua2 plugin has been released. Users on the Jetbrains platform can try using this plugin, which internally integrates `EmmyLuaAnalyzer`, `EmmyLuaCodeStyle`, and `EmmyLuaDebugger` used in vscode. In the future, `intellij-emmylua2-unity` and `intellij-emmylua2-attachdebugger` will also be available.

`NEW` Added configuration documentation: https://github.com/CppCXY/EmmyLuaAnalyzer/blob/master/docs/.emmyrc.json_EN.md

# 0.8.17

`FIX` Fixed the issue with incorrect Linux directories.

`FIX` Fixed inference issues related to the `table<TKey, TValue>` annotation.

`FIX` Fixed a bug where global variables marked as classes could not be referenced elsewhere.

`NEW` Added support for the `@source "<uri>#<line>:<col>"` annotation. When a field has this annotation, jumping will go to the specified location in the source.

`NEW` VSCode-EmmyLua-Unity will be released soon (August 8, 2024). The API exported using this plugin will follow the rules of xlua and support jumping to the corresponding C# implementation for fields.

`NEW` Enum annotation `@enum` supports `key` attribute, for example:
```lua
---@enum (key) AAA
---| CS.A.B.C AAA
```
This way, during code completion, it will automatically complete as `CS.A.B.C` instead of `AAA.CS.A.B.C`.

# 0.8.16

`CHG` All function return values are treated as new instances, and modifications to their return values are independent between different instances.

`FIX` Fixed the bug where `_G` cannot be prompted and global variables cannot be added.

`FIX` Fixed the bug where table generics cannot participate in inference.

`NEW` Introduced a special generic type, `namespace<T : string>`, which attempts to reference namespaces. For example:
```lua
CS = {
  ---@type namespace<"UnityEngine">
  UnityEngine = {},
  ---@type namespace<"System">
  System = {},
}

```


# 0.8.15

`CHG` Refactored the underlying type system and index system.

`FIX` Fixed inline values calculation error.

`FIX` Fixed a bug where the return annotation was overridden by the function return type.

`FIX` Fixed a bug where the param annotation couldn't be applied to the parameters of a for-in statement.

`FIX` Fixed diagnostics issues with private and protected visibility.

`CHG` Changed the logic of type members. Now, type members cannot be extended arbitrarily. The specific behaviors are as follows:
* If a local variable is marked as `---@class`, other files cannot inject members into that class.
* If a global variable is marked as `---@class`, members can be injected into that class from other files.
* After a local variable is returned as a module, other files cannot inject members into that module.
* A global variable can have members injected from any file.

`NEW` Added support for attribute syntax for classes, e.g., `---@class (partial) A`, `---@enum (partial) B`.

`NEW` Added support for partial class annotation. If a class is marked as a partial class, it needs to be declared as a partial class in other files to extend its members. For example, extending the string type:
```lua
---@class (partial) string
local string = string

function string:split(sep)
end
```

`NEW` Added support for exact class annotation. If a class is marked as an exact class, only the members specified by `---@field` annotations can be used and defined. For example:

```lua
---@class (exact) AA
---@field a number
local AA = {}

AA.b = 123 -- error
AA.a = 456 -- ok

```

`NEW` Added diagnostics support for `inject-field-fail`, which is disabled by default.

`NEW` Added diagnostics support for `duplicate-type`, which is enabled by default.

`NEW` Code completion will hide members that are not visible based on visibility rules.

`NEW` Introduced namespace annotation `---@namespace` to mark the namespace of the current file. For example:
```lua
---@namespace System
```
After specifying the namespace in the current file, all types defined in that file will be under the specified namespace. Classes within the same namespace can be accessed without writing the namespace prefix.

`NEW` Introduced using annotation `---@using` to easily reference types from other namespaces. For example:
```lua
---@using System
```
After specifying the using annotation in the current file, types from the System namespace can be used directly. For example:
```lua
-- A.lua

---@namespace System
---@class FFI


-- B.lua
---@using System

---@type FFI

--- C.lua
---@type System.FFI
```

`NEW` When defining a type, if the name contains a dot (.), a namespace will be automatically created. For example:
```lua
---@class System.FFC
```

`NEW` Improved reference lookup rules. When searching for references using the members of the current class, references in the current class will be prioritized, followed by references in all subclasses. References in parent classes will not be searched.

`NEW` Improved code completion. When defining function statements with code snippet completion, the function definition will mimic the previous statement.


# 0.8.12

`FIX` Fixed code completion issues.

`FIX` Fixed a bug where function return types couldn't be inferred.

`NEW` Support for using `/` as a separator in require path suggestions, navigation, code analysis, and document links.

# 0.8.10

`NEW` Upgraded the version to 0.8.10, due to significant underlying changes, the version number was incremented by several versions, but from a binary perspective, version 10 is also version 2.

`NEW` Upgraded the dotnet version to 9.0 preview.

`CHG` Removed Newtonsoft.Json and replaced it with Text.Json. Removed omnisharp/csharp-language-server-protocol and replaced it with [EmmyLua.LanguageServer.Framework](https://github.com/CppCXY/LanguageServer.Framework).

`NEW` Used dotnet9 AOT publishing to improve runtime performance, but there is not much difference in memory usage.

`NOTE` EmmyLua.LanguageServer.Framework is a LSP framework that I have redeveloped to support the latest LSP standards and be compatible with AOT compilation. Feel free to check it out if you're interested.

`NEW` Added support for configuring `workspace.ignoreGlobs` to exclude directories using regular expressions. Refer to the documentation of Microsoft.Extensions.FileSystemGlobbing for the specific format.

```lua
local t = {}
---@mapping new
t:ctor(a, b)

t:new(1, 2)
```

# 0.8.0

Starting from this version, EmmyLua has removed the Java version of the language service and only supports the dotnet version of the language service, while also deleting all configurations previously provided for the Java version of the language service.

`NEW` Debugger updated to 1.8.2, fixed an error when tcpListen localhost

`FIX` Fixed an infinite recursion crash issue

```lua
---@generic T
---@param a UnityEngine.`T`
---@return T
local function f(a)
    
end

local GameObject = f("GameObject") -- UnityEngine.GameObject
```

Now generics can expand function parameters, please refer to the declarations of pcall and xpcall, pcall and xpcall will now change their signatures based on the type of the first parameter.
# 0.7.7

`FIX` Fixed the bug where the language service reports an error when \u{xxx} is in the invalid area of UTF8 encoding

    ---@type string
    aa = 1
}
```

`CHG` Refactored the declaration and index system, preparing for other plugins

`FIX` Fixed some inference bugs

`FIX` Implemented visibility check as correctly as possible. Visibility check supports @private, @public, @protected, @package annotations, which represent private, public, protected, package four kinds of visibility. The so-called package visibility refers to visibility within the same file

```json
{
  "strict": {
    "requirePath": true,
    "typeCall": true
  }
}
```
If `requirePath` is set to `false`, it allows require paths to not start from the root directory. If `typeCall` is set to `false`, it allows direct calls of any type to return the type itself.

`FIX` Fixed some inference issues

`FIX` Fixed crashes caused by duplicate file additions when workspaces overlap

`FIX` Fixed inline comment judgment logic

`FIX` Optimized generic function inference

# 0.7.1

`FIX` Debugger rolled back to 1.7.1, the debugger will be updated in the next version

---@overload fun(level: "ngx.WARN", msg)
---@param level number
function ngx.log(level, ...) end
```

## 0.4.18

`NEW` `@field` annotation now supports numeric field descriptions:
```lua

```
Index descriptions of numbers or strings are also supported:
```lua
---@field [number] string
---@field [string] string
```
Several ways can coexist in a class definition.

`NEW` supports emitter style overloading:
```lua

---@overload fun(a: "data", data)
---@overload fun(a: "listen", aa, bb, cc)
---@param a string
local function f(a, bbb)
end
```

`NEW` enumeration can mark inherited classes:
```lua
---@enum aaaa: number
```
After an enumeration inherits from a class, parameter type checking checks whether the parameter conforms to the parent class.

`NEW` supports enum based overloading:
```lua
---@enum IO: number
io = {
     Input = 1,
     Output = 2
}

---@overload fun(type: "IO.Input", in)
---@overload fun(type: "IO.Output", writeHandle)
---@param type IO
local function f(type, ...)
end
```

`NOTE` The new overloading style above must be `enum/string` in the first parameter of the function

## 0.4.16

`NEW` Experimental support feature `interface` This feature has the following characteristics:

`Feature 1` interface has the following written form:
```lua
---@interface A
---@field a number
---@field b number
```

`Feature 2` interfaces can be inherited:
```lua
---A is the interface A above
---@class C : A
```
When inheriting an interface, the diagnostic checks if the class implements the members of the interface

`Feature 3` When an interface is used as a parameter type, after the function parameter verification feature is enabled, it will check whether the incoming parameter conforms to the interface. If the incoming parameter is not inherited from the interface or is a table expression, then Will check each member of the interface definition for conformity

`Restriction` interface cannot inherit from other classes or other interfaces


`NEW` Multiple interface inheritance, type declarations can now multiple inherit interfaces in the following form
```lua
---@interface b
---@interface c

---@class a: b, c
```
`Restriction`: In the case of multiple inheritance, only one class is allowed to inherit, the rest can only be interfaces, and the class is only allowed to appear in the first inheritance bit

## 0.4.15
